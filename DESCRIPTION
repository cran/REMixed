Description: Implementation of an algorithm in two steps to estimate parameters of a model whose latent dynamics are inferred through latent processes, jointly regularized. This package uses 'Monolix' software (<https://monolixsuite.slp-software.com/>), which provide robust statistical method for non-linear mixed effects modeling. 'Monolix' must have been installed prior to use.
